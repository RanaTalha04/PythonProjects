# Python Project

This repository will contain the programs I will make during my learning session. Currently, there are 2 programs:

1. The first program is a simple calculator, which performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program was created when I started learning Python programming language and it was my first program. Here is the link to this program: https://github.com/RanaTalha04/PythonProjects/blob/master/Calculator.py

2. The Second program is a simple greeting program, which uses local machine time and greet according to your name.
