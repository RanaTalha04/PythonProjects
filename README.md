# Python Project

This repository contains the programs I will create during my Python learning course. Currently, there are 3 programs:

1. The first program is a simple calculator, which performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program was created when I started learning Python programming language and it was my first program. Here is the link to this program: https://github.com/RanaTalha04/PythonProjects/blob/master/Calculator.py

2. The Second program is a simple greeting program, which uses local machine time and greet according to your name. This program was created when I started learning Python programming language and it was my first program. Here is the link to this program: https://github.com/RanaTalha04/PythonProjects/blob/master/GreetingProgram.py

3. The Third program is a simple game with some questions and 4 options in which one is correct and the user is prompted to give an option as an answer. This game is created using lists and some loops. Here is the link to this program: https://github.com/RanaTalha04/PythonProjects/blob/master/KBC.py
